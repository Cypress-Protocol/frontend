### Introduction
This README provides essential information for developers working on the Cypress App's React Native frontend. Cypress is a sustainable transportation and virtual garden application that rewards users for making eco-friendly travel choices. The frontend is built using React Native, a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js**: You need Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- **React Native**: Make sure you have React Native set up.
- **Expo**: We use Expo for easy development and testing.

### Getting Started

#### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change your directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd cypress-app-react-native
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Running the App
1. Start the development server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. You will be provided with options to run the app on a physical device, emulator, or web browser. Choose the appropriate option for your development environment.

3. The app should now be running, and you can see it on your chosen platform.

### Project Structure
- `App.js`: The entry point of the application.
- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the Cypress app.
- `src/components/`: Reusable components used throughout the app.
- `src/screens/`: Screen components for various app screens.
- `src/navigation/`: Navigation setup for the app.
- `src/api/`: API integration for backend services.
- `src/styles/`: Styles and theme configuration.
- `assets/`: Static assets such as images, fonts, and icons.
- `config/`: Configuration files, constants, and environment variables.

### Tech Stack
- **React Native**: The framework for building the mobile app.
- **Expo**: Enhances the development experience.
- **React Navigation**: For app navigation.
- **Axios**: Handles HTTP requests.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **React Redux**: Integrates Redux with React.
- **React Native Paper**: UI component library.


## Project Overview

Cypress is a dApp that we have developed with Vechain that utilizes cryptocurrency to incentivize users to make sustainable travel choices. Our project aims to be a part of the solution to the environmental degradation that is caused by urbanization and the increasing levels of carbon emissions in cities. Consumers may not produce the majority of pollution but they are the majority of the populationâ€“ Cypress allows conscious consumers to be a part of a community that values sustainability on every level. On Cypress users can build their own virtual garden for simply traveling sustainably. Cypress uses 3 party integrations from sustainable transportation companies such as Uber, MBTA, and BlueBike in order to verify that users have taken one of those forms of transportation. From there, Cypress uses Vechain technology to distribute VET to those users. This VET can then be used within the app to purchase flowers for a virtual garden. Users can expand their gardens, unlock new flowers, complete challenges, and compare their impact with friends. We use Vechain to distribute the incentive in cryptocurrency which is highly secure and promotes a system with low carbon emissions.
